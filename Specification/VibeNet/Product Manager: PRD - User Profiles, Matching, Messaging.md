- As a user, I want to receive daily match recommendations so that I can consistently expand my network
- As a user, I want to understand why each match was recommended so that I can make an informed decision
- As a user, I want to dismiss matches I'm not interested in so that future recommendations improve
- As a user, I want to accept matches with one click so that connecting is frictionless

### Acceptance Criteria
- Match recommendations generated within 500ms of page load (from pre-computed cache)
- Each match displays: name, role, company, match score (0–100%), one-sentence AI explanation
- Match score updates within 6 hours of any profile change
- Dismissed matches never reappear
- Match acceptance triggers connection request to the other user

### Functional Specifications

**Match Score Calculation (MVP):**
- Skill overlap: 30% weight
- Industry alignment: 20% weight
- Location proximity: 10% weight
- Mutual connections: 20% weight
- Profile completeness: 10% weight

## Dependencies and Risks

**Dependencies:**
- Matching algorithm requires minimum 1,000 profiles to produce quality results (chicken-and-egg problem)
- AI explanation requires LLM API integration (OpenAI or Anthropic)
- Real-time messaging requires WebSocket infrastructure

**Risks:**
- **Match quality on launch:** Mitigate by seeding platform with curated profiles before public launch
- **LLM API costs:** Mitigate by caching explanations and only regenerating on significant profile changes
- **Cold start problem:** Mitigate by using rule-based matching until sufficient interaction data is collected
